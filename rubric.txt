Part 1:
1. Use this space to provide constructive feedback to the student who
submitted the work. Point out the strengths of their application, and give
them advice about how it could be improved in the future.

2. Was there enough documentation on the shiny site for a user to get started
using the application?

3. Did the application run as described in the documentation?

4. Was there some form of widget input (slider, textbox, radio buttons,
checkbox, ...) in either ui.R or a custom web page?

5. Did server.R perform some calculations on the input in server.R?

6. Was the server calculation displayed in the html page?

7. Was the app substantively different than the very simple applications
built in the class? Note, it's OK if the app is simple and based on the one
presented in class, I just don't want it to be basically a carbon copy of the
examples we covered. As an example, if someone simply changed the variable
names, then this would not count. However, a prediction algorithm that had
a similar layout would be fine.

8. Here's your opportunity to give the app +1 for being well done, or neat,
or even just a solid effort.

9. If any of your grading decisions require explanation, please note your
explanations here.

Part 2:

1. Was the presentation completed in slidify or R Presenter?

2. Was it 5 pages?

3. Did it contain an R expression that got evaluated and displayed?

4. Was it hosted on github or Rpubs?

5. Was the presentation actually a presentation? (I.e. it had a legitimate
pitch for the shiny application?)

6. Here's your opportunity to give this presentation a +1 for being well done.
Did they tinker around with the default style? Was the presentation
particularly lucid and well organized? In other words, the student made a
legitimate try.

7. There were no R errors displayed in the presentation.

8. If any of your grading decisions require explanation, please note your
explanations here.
